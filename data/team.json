What he lacks in neutrino particle physics knowledge he makes up for in crafting sustainable, responsive front-end systems and Drupal websites using the latest techniques and tools. Before coming to Penn State, Michael worked for multiple startups where he used and abused Drupal to quickly prototype ideas and solve technological problems for businesses.  As an educational technologist, he brings that same passion of solving problems with technology to online learning. Michael is also a core developer for the open-source Drupal platform, ELMS Learning Network.",

    "description":"<p>I came to Penn State with the intention of studying mechanical engineering for four years and leaving. I can’t be more happy that I accomplished none of those things. I’ve been working with online learning technology for about a decade. I started teaching digital media art when I was in graduate school, and during that time discovered that I have a knack for crashing 3D software during in-class demos. Save early, save iteratively, save often.</p><p>I prefer to work with people who don’t take “...but this doesn’t exist!” for an answer. Educational Technologist is a vague job title, but essentially it means that I’m passionate about using design and technology to push education forward in a sustainable way. More specifically, I maintain, design, and build online learning infrastructure. Right now we are running on a massive open-source project called ELMS Learning Network. One project that I’m really excited about right now is called HAX, an intuitive drag and drop content authoring interface for Drupal that will one day replace Drupal’s WYSIWYG.</p><p>My Spotify playlist is typically hard at work making sure my brain is happy while I’m working through design or code problems. When I’m not working, you can find me... wait, no, you can’t find me because I’m riding on some singletrack with no cell reception. That or I’m traveling to give a talk or volunteer at a nerdy tech conference like SIGGRAPH or DrupalCon.</p>",

She got her start as a freelance designer for private companies and K-12 education institutions, and then moved on to Drexel University before returning to Penn State in 2015. Katrina looks forward to extinguishing traditional models of postsecondary education in favor of guiding students and educators toward new paradigms focused on individuals and their unique educational goals and motivations. Ultimately, she is focused on improving educational opportunities for all in the hope that educated citizens in turn focus on improving the world.</p>",

The result was a decade long struggle to learn coding languages, design software, web technologies, data analysis and research techniques from scratch in an attempt to design course experiences that took into account emerging <strike>pedagogigoies</strike> education theories for online learning. Already a supporter of open source, in 2014 he stumbled across ELMS:LN and instantly resonated with the flexibility and potential of not only being able to build the course content, but also the learning tools themselves. He now uses ELMS:LN to power the learning experience of over 50,000 students and regularly contributes thoughts, ideas and bug reports to the issue queue while the rest of the ELMS:LN team are sleeping.
